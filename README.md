# DeepPIP
Notebooks used to create and analyse DeepPIP as part of my 2023 MRes MLBD Individual Project.

1 - Classifier.ipynb - Loads in IEDB viral immunogenic data to train a deep classifier model (DeepPIP).
2 - Mutation Analysis.ipynb - Loads in SARS-CoV-2 mutation data from GISAID and uses the DeepPIP model to analyse immune evasion.
